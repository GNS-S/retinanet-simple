# retinanet-simple

An even more simplified version of the [RetinaNet implemention by yhenon](https://github.com/yhenon/pytorch-retinanet)

Made as reference and for playing around with object detection for coursework 

It is better to use the aforementioned repository for making anything to do with RetinaNet
